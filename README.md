# Simulating Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles in a periodic boundary condition (PBC), using Molecular Dynamics (MD)

The code here is capable of simulating LJ particles in a cubic PBC. The LJ parameters, number of the particles, and the size of the box is adjustbale. The code outputs energy and position files. The trajectory can be visualzied in VMD as a XYZ file.
The code is capable of running NVE and NVT ensambles. The temperature is controled by the Anderson thermostat.
